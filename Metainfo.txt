Description: Pink noise is a signal with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density is inversly proportional to the frequency of the signal. We generate the pink noise using AR model with high positive alpha and produce ACF and PACF plots. 

Keywords: Spectral Analysis, Pink Noise, Autocorrelation function (ACF), Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF)
